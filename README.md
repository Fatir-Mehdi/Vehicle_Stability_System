# Vehicle_Stability_System
A vehicle stability system, or Electronic Stability Control (ESC), is an automotive safety feature that improves handling by monitoring wheel speed, steering, and acceleration. If it detects potential skidding, the system adjusts braking and engine power to help the driver maintain control, reducing the risk of accidents.

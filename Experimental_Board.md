Experimental board CO4203-6W designated "Vehicle stability systems" consists of four
individually driven wheels to simulate ABS / ASR / ESP operations.

Connecting the experiment board
Plug board CO4203-6W into the UniTrain CO4203-2A.
Putting the experiment board into operation
The ignition switch is located in the lower area of the board. The switch's positions from
left to right are: Ignition off - Ignition on - Start engine. First turn the switch fully to the right
so that the wheels start turning.
You can now speed up or slow down the vehicle by means of the corresponding slide
controls.
You can set the road conditions individually by means of the corresponding buttons in the
board's left area.
You can adjust the vehicle's tendency to understeer or oversteer. This has an effect on
the brake circuit in the ESP mode.
You can change the steering angle by adjusting the steering wheel. The steering angle is
indicated by the LED arc in the board's left area.

## Tyre slip
Tyre slip results from the difference between the theoretical and actual distances covered by one
revolution of the wheel. When a tyre rolls on the road, the tyre's rubber elements brace and result in
sliding motion. Especially during braking, while the wheel is still not blocked, this makes the distance
actually covered greater than the distance theoretically covered by the tyre's rolling circumference.
Only under these conditions is it possible to transmit braking as well as acceleration forces.
Slip therefore occurs when the wheel's circumferential speed is lower or higher than the vehicle's
travelling speed (see the illustration below).

## Inertia
Inertia describes every object's tendency to maintain its instantaneous state of rest or motion. A force
is needed to change this state or motion.
An object's rotary motion is influenced by moments. For instance, a wheel's rotation is influenced by
drive and braking torques. While a vehicle is moving, a number of forces and moments act all over it.

## Kamm's circle
Kamm's circle represents the relationship between the forces mentioned above. The circle's radius
corresponds to the maximum total available power which can be transmitted by the wheel to the road.
As the sum of the forces approaches the maximum limit, the degree of slip increases until the wheel
completely loses its grip. In this process, static friction is transformed into sliding friction. This causes
the vehicle to swerve in an absence of any tracking capability, for instance.
